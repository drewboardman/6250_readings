### 1st pass
  1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
  2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore
  everything else
  3. Read the conclusions
  4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the
  ones you’ve already read

Then you should be able to answer the following questions

  1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement
  paper? An analysis of an existing system? A
  description of a research prototype?
  2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which
  theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
  3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
  4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
  5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

Ultimately decide if you even want to read the full paper after the first pass

### 2nd pass
  - don't spend more than 1 hour
  - ignore things like proof and other super detailed stuff
  - either print out the paper and take notes in the margins, or take notes on
    paper
  - look at the figures and graphs is great detail. Make sure you understand the
    figures

### 3rd pass
  - takes 4 or 5 hours
  - here you literally re-implement the paper and try to verify the assumptions
    it makes
